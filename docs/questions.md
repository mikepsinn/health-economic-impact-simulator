## Muscle Mass Impact Analysis
1. What is the economic impact of a therapy showing 2 lb muscle gain across populations?
   - Cumulative reduction in obesity-related healthcare costs across US population
   - Cumulative reduction in obesity-related healthcare costs across Medicare population
   - Impact on workforce productivity metrics
   - Potential Medicare savings from reduced comorbidities

## Fat Reduction Impact Analysis
2. What is the economic impact of a therapy showing 2 lb fat reduction across populations?
   - Cumulative reduction in obesity-related healthcare costs across US population
   - Cumulative reduction in obesity-related healthcare costs across Medicare population
   - Impact on workforce productivity metrics
   - Potential Medicare savings from reduced comorbidities

## Lifespan Extension Impact Analysis
3. What are the economic implications of a 2.5% lifespan extension?
   - Estimated GDP increase from extended workforce participation
   - Annual Medicare savings from delayed age-related care
   - Economic value of additional healthy life years gained

### IQ Enhancement Impact Analysis
- Economic value of 2-5 IQ point increase across population
- Productivity gains from cognitive enhancement
   
### Alzheimer's Progression Impact Analysis
- Healthcare cost reduction from 2-year delay in Alzheimer's progression
- Economic value of preserved cognitive function
- Reduced dementia care costs
   
### Kidney Disease Impact Analysis
   - Healthcare savings from 2-year delay in kidney disease progression
   - Medicare savings from delayed ESRD progression
   - Economic impact of improved quality of life


### Study Design Considerations
4. How to structure clinical studies for direct model input:
   - Which biomarkers (eGFR/cystatin C) show strongest outcome correlations?
   - Should we stratify by age groups (e.g., >60 vs younger adults)?
   - What follow-up duration is needed to capture economic impacts?

5. For target population analysis:
   - Which subpopulations show strongest cost-benefit ratios?
   - How do outcomes differ between preventive vs treatment use cases?
   - What existing research correlations can we leverage (e.g., muscle mass â†’ hospital visits)?

### Implementation Framework
6. How to balance model complexity:
   - What's the minimum viable model for initial validation?
   - Which parameters need most sensitivity analysis?
   - Where should we prioritize adding complexity first?

7. For stakeholder alignment:
   - How does the model inform target gene selection?
   - What regulatory metrics map best to Medicare cost savings?
   - How to present findings for HHS/CMS engagement?
