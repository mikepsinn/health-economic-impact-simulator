### Study Design Considerations
How to structure clinical studies for direct model input:
   - Which biomarkers (eGFR/cystatin C) show strongest outcome correlations?
   - Should we stratify by age groups (e.g., >60 vs younger adults)?
   - What follow-up duration is needed to capture economic impacts?

For target population analysis:
   - Which subpopulations show strongest cost-benefit ratios?
   - How do outcomes differ between preventive vs treatment use cases?
   - What existing research correlations can we leverage (e.g., muscle mass → hospital visits)?

### Implementation Framework
How to balance model complexity:
   - What's the minimum viable model for initial validation?
   - Which parameters need most sensitivity analysis?
   - Where should we prioritize adding complexity first?

For stakeholder alignment:
   - How does the model inform target gene selection?
   - What regulatory metrics map best to Medicare cost savings?
   - How to present findings for HHS/CMS engagement?
