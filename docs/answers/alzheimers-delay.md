# 2-year delay in Alzheimer's progression impact

Delaying the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by two years can yield significant health and economic benefits. To estimate these benefits, we'll consider the following factors:

1. **Reduction in Healthcare Costs**: Slowing disease progression can decrease the need for medical services, including hospitalizations, medications, and outpatient visits.

2. **Reduction in Caregiving Costs**: A delay in disease progression can reduce the burden on caregivers, leading to lower associated costs.

3. **Improvement in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**: Extending the period during which patients maintain higher cognitive function enhances their quality of life.

**Assumptions and Parameters**:

- **Number of Patients**: As of 2022, there were approximately 3.3 million individuals in the U.S. with mild AD, projected to increase to 14.6 million by 2032.

- **Per-Patient Annual Costs**:
  - **Healthcare Costs**: Delaying progression from mild to moderate AD by one year reduces healthcare costs by $34,249 per patient. ([Health Care Choice Initiative](https://ecchc.economics.uchicago.edu/2022/11/29/the-value-of-innovation-delaying-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease-in-the-us/))
  - **Caregiving Costs**: A one-year delay results in a reduction of $7,882 in non-market caregiving costs per patient. ([Health Care Choice Initiative](https://ecchc.economics.uchicago.edu/2022/11/29/the-value-of-innovation-delaying-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease-in-the-us/))

- **Quality of Life Improvement**: A one-year delay leads to an increase of 0.16 QALYs per patient. ([Health Care Choice Initiative](https://ecchc.economics.uchicago.edu/2022/11/29/the-value-of-innovation-delaying-the-progression-of-alzheimers-disease-in-the-us/))

**Calculations**:

1. **Total Cost Savings per Patient for a Two-Year Delay**:
   - **Healthcare Cost Savings**: $34,249 (per year) × 2 years = $68,498
   - **Caregiving Cost Savings**: $7,882 (per year) × 2 years = $15,764
   - **Total Cost Savings per Patient**: $68,498 + $15,764 = $84,262

2. **Total QALYs Gained per Patient for a Two-Year Delay**:
   - 0.16 QALYs (per year) × 2 years = 0.32 QALYs

3. **Aggregate Benefits**:
   - **For 2022**:
     - **Total Cost Savings**: $84,262 × 3,300,000 patients = $278,064,600,000
     - **Total QALYs Gained**: 0.32 QALYs × 3,300,000 patients = 1,056,000 QALYs
   - **For 2032**:
     - **Total Cost Savings**: $84,262 × 14,600,000 patients = $1,230,225,200,000
     - **Total QALYs Gained**: 0.32 QALYs × 14,600,000 patients = 4,672,000 QALYs

**Conclusion**:

Implementing a therapy that delays the progression of Alzheimer's disease by two years could result in substantial economic savings and significant improvements in patient quality of life. These estimates underscore the potential value of investing in treatments that effectively slow the progression of AD.
