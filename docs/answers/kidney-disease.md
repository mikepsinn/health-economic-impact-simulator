# Kidney Disease

To estimate the health and economic benefits of a therapy that increases Klotho levels and prevents kidney disease across the Medicare and total U.S. population, we need to assess the following:

1. **Prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):**
   - Over 26 million Americans are affected by CKD. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3911771/))

2. **Medicare Population:**
   - Medicare primarily covers individuals aged 65 and older. As of 2023, approximately 66 million people are enrolled in Medicare. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/top-medicare-drugs-headed-price-cuts-2024-08-15/))

3. **CKD Prevalence in Medicare Beneficiaries:**
   - CKD is common among Medicare beneficiaries, with a significant portion affected by the disease. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3752941/))

4. **Annual Medicare Costs Attributable to CKD:**
   - Per person annual Medicare expenses attributable to CKD were $1,700 for stage 2, $3,500 for stage 3, and $12,700 for stage 4, adjusted to 2010 dollars. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3752941/))

5. **Total Medicare Spending on CKD:**
   - In 2017, Medicare spending for all beneficiaries who had CKD exceeded $120 billion, representing 33.8% of total Medicare fee-for-service spending. ([AJMC](https://www.ajmc.com/view/medical-costs-for-managing-chronic-kidney-disease-and-related-complications-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-and-type-2-diabetes))

6. **Potential Impact of Klotho-Enhancing Therapy:**
   - Emerging evidence suggests that CKD is associated with Klotho deficiency. Supplementation of exogenous Klotho and/or up-regulation of endogenous Klotho production may confer renoprotection and prevent or alleviate complications in CKD. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3911771/))

**Calculations:**

- **Assumptions:**
  - A therapy that increases Klotho levels could prevent the progression of CKD, particularly from stages 3 and 4 to less severe stages.
  - For this model, we'll assume a hypothetical 10% reduction in the number of patients progressing to stages 3 and 4 due to the therapy.

- **Number of Medicare Beneficiaries with CKD:**
  - Total Medicare beneficiaries: 66 million.
  - Assuming 20% have CKD: 66 million * 20% = 13.2 million beneficiaries with CKD.

- **Distribution Across CKD Stages:**
  - Stage 2: 20%
  - Stage 3: 60%
  - Stage 4: 20%

  - Stage 2: 13.2 million * 20% = 2.64 million
  - Stage 3: 13.2 million * 60% = 7.92 million
  - Stage 4: 13.2 million * 20% = 2.64 million

- **Cost Savings from Therapy:**
  - Preventing 10% progression:
    - Stage 3: 7.92 million * 10% = 792,000 patients
    - Stage 4: 2.64 million * 10% = 264,000 patients

  - **Annual Cost Savings:**
    - Stage 3: 792,000 patients * $3,500 = $2.772 billion
    - Stage 4: 264,000 patients * $12,700 = $3.355 billion

  - **Total Annual Savings:**
    - $2.772 billion + $3.355 billion = $6.127 billion

**Conclusion:**

Implementing a therapy that increases Klotho levels and prevents the progression of CKD could potentially save the Medicare system approximately $6.127 billion annually. This estimate is based on a conservative assumption of a 10% reduction in disease progression. Further research is needed to determine the actual efficacy of such therapies and their broader economic impacts.
