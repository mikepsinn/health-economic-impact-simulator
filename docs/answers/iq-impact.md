# 5 IQ point increase impact

Enhancing the average intelligence quotient (IQ) of the U.S. population by 5 points could have significant economic and social implications. To estimate these benefits, we can analyze the relationship between IQ and individual earnings, and then extrapolate to the national level.

**1. Individual Earnings Increase per IQ Point**

Research indicates that each additional IQ point is associated with an approximate 1.76% increase in annual earnings. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8146900/))

**2. Current U.S. Population and Workforce Data**

- **Total U.S. Population (2025):** Estimated at 340 million.
- **Labor Force Participation Rate:** Approximately 62.8%.
- **Number of Individuals in the Labor Force:** 340 million * 0.628 ≈ 213.5 million.

**3. Median Annual Earnings**

As of recent data, the median annual earnings for full-time workers in the U.S. is approximately $50,000.

**4. Calculating the Earnings Increase**

- **Percentage Increase for a 5-Point IQ Rise:** 1.76% * 5 = 8.8%.
- **Additional Annual Earnings per Worker:** $50,000 * 0.088 = $4,400.
- **Total Additional Earnings for the Labor Force:** $4,400 * 213.5 million ≈ $939.4 billion.

**5. Broader Economic Impacts**

Beyond individual earnings, a higher national average IQ could lead to:

- **Increased Productivity:** Enhanced problem-solving abilities and innovation.
- **Improved Health Outcomes:** Higher IQ is linked to better health decisions, potentially reducing healthcare costs.
- **Greater Social Mobility:** Elevated cognitive abilities can lead to higher educational attainment and upward social movement.

**Conclusion**

A 5-point increase in the average IQ of the U.S. population could potentially result in an annual earnings boost of approximately $939.4 billion, alongside various other societal benefits. It's important to note that these estimates are based on observed correlations and may not capture all variables involved. 

To model the benefits of a 5-point IQ increase across the US population, we synthesize data from multiple studies on IQ’s economic impact, productivity, and human capital. Below is a step-by-step mathematical framework:

---

### **1. Key Parameters and Assumptions**
#### **a. IQ-GDP Relationship** 
- A **1-point increase in national IQ** correlates with a **7.8% rise in GDP per capita** (long-term effect), based on Bayesian analysis of 67 variables across 106 countries.
- Formula:  
  $$\Delta \text{GDP}_{\text{per capita}} = \text{GDP}_{\text{base}} \times (1 + 0.078)^{\Delta \text{IQ}}$$  
  For a 5-point increase:  
  $$\Delta \text{GDP}_{\text{per capita}} = \text{GDP}_{\text{base}} \times (1 + 0.078)^5 - \text{GDP}_{\text{base}}$$

#### **b. Current US Economic Data** 
- **2025 US GDP**: ~\$28.3 trillion (assuming 3% annual growth from 2023’s \$26.9 trillion).  
- **Population**: 340 million.  
- **GDP per capita**:  
  $$\text{GDP}_{\text{per capita}} = \frac{\$28.3 \text{ trillion}}{340 \text{ million}} \approx \$83,235.$$

#### **c. Productivity Link** 
- Higher IQ improves workforce productivity. A 5-point IQ increase could boost productivity by **3–5% annually**, compounding GDP growth.  
- Correlation between IQ and job performance: $r = 0.53$ .

### **2. Direct GDP Impact**
Using the IQ-GDP elasticity from :  
$$\Delta \text{GDP}_{\text{total}} = \text{GDP}_{\text{base}} \times \left[(1 + 0.078)^5 - 1\right]$$  
Substituting values:  
$$\Delta \text{GDP}_{\text{total}} = \$28.3 \text{ trillion} \times (1.456 - 1) = \$12.9 \text{ trillion over 10–20 years}.$$

#### **Annualized GDP Growth**  
Assuming the effect materializes over 15 years:  
$$\text{Annual GDP Boost} = \frac{\$12.9 \text{ trillion}}{15} \approx \$860 \text{ billion/year}.$$

### **3. Productivity and Wages**
#### **a. Productivity Gains**   
- US productivity post-2023 grew at **3% annually**. A 5-point IQ increase could add **1.2–2 percentage points** (40–67% of current growth), driven by:  
  - **Reskilling**: Workers in higher-value roles.  
  - **Automation/AI**: Enhanced by cognitive ability.  
- Formula:  
  $$\Delta \text{Productivity} = 0.03 \times (1 + 0.4) = 4.2\% \text{ annual growth}.$$

#### **b. Wage Increases**   
- A 5-point IQ rise correlates with **10–15% higher lifetime earnings** (e.g., moving from mean IQ 100 to 105).  
- Aggregate wage boost:  
  $$\Delta \text{Wages} = 340 \text{ million} \times \$83,235 \times 0.12 \approx \$3.4 \text{ trillion annually}.$$

---

### **4. Demographic and Fiscal Benefits**
#### **a. Labor Market Efficiency**   
- Reduced worker shortages (currently **760,000 unfilled jobs**) via higher cognitive matching.  
- Estimated **2–3% decline in unemployment**, adding \$180–\$270 billion to GDP.

#### **b. Reduced Welfare Costs**   
- Lower IQ correlates with higher welfare dependency. A 5-point increase could reduce welfare spending by **\$50–\$100 billion annually**.

### **5. Long-Term Projections**  
Using ’s NAEP-based IQ growth model:  
- A 5-point IQ gain accelerates the Flynn Effect, closing **White-Black and White-Hispanic gaps by 50%** over 30 years.  
- Compounded GDP growth:  
  $$\text{GDP}_{2060} = \$28.3 \text{ trillion} \times (1.03 + 0.012)^{35} \approx \$97 \text{ trillion (vs. \$73 \text{ trillion baseline})}.$$

### **6. Limitations**  
- **Nonlinear Effects**: Diminishing returns may apply at higher IQ levels .  
- **Causality**: IQ gains require complementary investments in education and technology .  

---

### **Conclusion**  
A 5-point IQ increase could elevate US GDP by **\$12.9 trillion long-term**, boost productivity by **1.2–2% annually**, and raise wages by **\$3.4 trillion/year**. This aligns with studies linking cognitive ability to economic growth  and productivity .
