# Study Design Considerations

To rigorously populate the economic and health impact models, the following study design framework is proposed.

## 1. Clinical Trial Structure

### Phase II/III Clinical Trials
1. **Body Composition Analysis**  
   - **Primary Methods**: DXA scans or MRI to measure changes in muscle and fat mass over time
   - **Key Endpoints**: 
     - ΔM (muscle gain in lbs)
     - ΔF (fat loss in lbs)
   - **Measurement Schedule**: Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year

2. **Health Economics Data Collection**  
   - **Healthcare Utilization**: 
     - Track hospital visits (% reduction)
     - Monitor prescription usage
     - Record outpatient visits
   - **Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment**:
     - SF-36 survey
     - EQ-5D questionnaire
     - Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scores

3. **Longevity Assessment**  
   - **Biomarkers of Aging**:
     - Epigenetic clocks
     - Inflammatory markers
     - Metabolic parameters
   - **Long-term Follow-up**:
     - Annual health assessments
     - Mortality tracking
     - Lifespan projections
   - **Phase IV (Post-marketing)**:
     - Real-world Medicare claims analysis
     - Healthcare cost tracking

## 2. Data Collection Framework

### 2.1 Standardized Data Collection
Required measurements for the unified impact model:
1. Physical Changes
   - Muscle mass change (lbs)
   - Fat mass change (lbs)
2. Healthcare Impact
   - Hospital visit reduction (%)
   - Healthcare cost savings per lb improvement
3. Longevity Effects
   - Projected lifespan increase (years)
   - Health quality improvement (%)

### 2.2 Integration with Economic Models
Data feeds directly into the unified impact model for:
- Healthcare savings calculations
- GDP impact projections
- Medicare cost analysis
- QALY assessments

## 3. Study Population Considerations

### 3.1 Demographics
- Age groups: 40-65, 65-80, 80+
- Gender balance
- Ethnic diversity
- Geographic distribution
- Socioeconomic representation

### 3.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
- **Include**:
  - Adults aged 40+
  - Various health status backgrounds
  - Different fitness levels
- **Exclude**:
  - Severe muscle wasting conditions
  - Active cancer treatments
  - Certain genetic conditions

## 4. Outcome Measures

### 4.1 Primary Endpoints
Aligned with model parameters:
- Changes in muscle mass (lbs)
- Changes in fat mass (lbs)
- Hospital visit reduction (%)
- Quality of life improvement (%)
- Projected lifespan increase (years)

### 4.2 Secondary Endpoints
Supporting data for model validation:
- Metabolic health markers
- Cardiovascular parameters
- Functional assessments
- Economic indicators

## 5. Data Analysis Plan

### 5.1 Statistical Methods
Methods to validate model assumptions:
- Mixed effects models
- Survival analysis
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
- Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculations

### 5.2 Economic Analysis
Direct inputs for impact model:
- Healthcare cost savings per lb
- Annual productivity value
- Medicare spending effects
- Discount rate calculations

## 6. Timeline and Milestones

### 6.1 Study Phases
1. **Setup**: 6 months
   - Protocol finalization
   - Site selection
   - IRB approvals

2. **Enrollment**: 12 months
   - Patient recruitment
   - Baseline assessments
   - Initial treatments

3. **Follow-up**: 24+ months
   - Regular assessments
   - Data collection
   - Interim analyses

4. **Analysis**: 6 months
   - Final data analysis
   - Economic modeling
   - Report generation

### 6.2 Key Milestones
- Protocol approval
- First patient enrolled
- Enrollment complete
- Primary endpoint data
- Final study report
