# Study Design Considerations

To rigorously populate the economic and health impact models, the following study design framework is proposed.

## 1. Clinical Trial Structure

### Phase II/III Clinical Trials
1. **Body Composition Analysis**  
   - **Primary Methods**: DXA scans or MRI to measure changes in muscle and fat mass over time
   - **Key Endpoints**: 
     - ΔM (muscle gain)
     - ΔF (fat loss)
   - **Measurement Schedule**: Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year

2. **Health Economics Data Collection**  
   - **Healthcare Utilization**: 
     - Track hospital visits
     - Monitor prescription usage
     - Record outpatient visits
   - **Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment**:
     - SF-36 survey
     - EQ-5D questionnaire
     - Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scores

3. **Longitudinal Survival Data**  
   - **Biomarkers of Aging**:
     - Epigenetic clocks
     - Inflammatory markers
     - Metabolic parameters
   - **Long-term Follow-up**:
     - Annual health assessments
     - Mortality tracking
   - **Phase IV (Post-marketing)**:
     - Real-world Medicare claims analysis
     - Healthcare cost tracking

## 2. Data Collection Framework

### 2.1 Standardized Data Formats
- All study data must be collected in standardized formats:
  - CDISC for clinical trial data
  - HL7 FHIR for healthcare records
  - SNOMED CT for medical terminology

### 2.2 Integration with Economic Models
- Data will be exported to Python models for:
  - Real-time cost-effectiveness updates
  - Iterative refinement of economic projections
  - Population health impact assessments

## 3. Study Population Considerations

### 3.1 Demographics
- Age groups: 40-65, 65-80, 80+
- Gender balance
- Ethnic diversity
- Geographic distribution
- Socioeconomic representation

### 3.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
- **Include**:
  - Adults aged 40+
  - Various health status backgrounds
  - Different fitness levels
- **Exclude**:
  - Severe muscle wasting conditions
  - Active cancer treatments
  - Certain genetic conditions

## 4. Outcome Measures

### 4.1 Primary Endpoints
- Changes in muscle mass
- Changes in fat mass
- Healthcare utilization rates
- Quality of life scores

### 4.2 Secondary Endpoints
- Metabolic health markers
- Cardiovascular parameters
- Functional assessments
- Economic indicators

## 5. Data Analysis Plan

### 5.1 Statistical Methods
- Mixed effects models
- Survival analysis
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
- Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculations

### 5.2 Economic Analysis
- Healthcare cost modeling
- Productivity impact assessment
- Medicare spending projections
- GDP contribution calculations

## 6. Timeline and Milestones

### 6.1 Study Phases
1. **Setup**: 6 months
   - Protocol finalization
   - Site selection
   - IRB approvals

2. **Enrollment**: 12 months
   - Patient recruitment
