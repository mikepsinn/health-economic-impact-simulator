# 5 IQ point increase impact

Enhancing the average intelligence quotient (IQ) of the U.S. population by 5 points could have significant economic and social implications. To estimate these benefits, we can analyze the relationship between IQ and individual earnings, and then extrapolate to the national level.

**1. Individual Earnings Increase per IQ Point**

Research indicates that each additional IQ point is associated with an approximate 1.76% increase in annual earnings. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8146900/))

**2. Current U.S. Population and Workforce Data**

- **Total U.S. Population (2025):** Estimated at 340 million.
- **Labor Force Participation Rate:** Approximately 62.8%.
- **Number of Individuals in the Labor Force:** 340 million * 0.628 ≈ 213.5 million.

**3. Median Annual Earnings**

As of recent data, the median annual earnings for full-time workers in the U.S. is approximately $50,000.

**4. Calculating the Earnings Increase**

- **Percentage Increase for a 5-Point IQ Rise:** 1.76% * 5 = 8.8%.
- **Additional Annual Earnings per Worker:** $50,000 * 0.088 = $4,400.
- **Total Additional Earnings for the Labor Force:** $4,400 * 213.5 million ≈ $939.4 billion.

**5. Broader Economic Impacts**

Beyond individual earnings, a higher national average IQ could lead to:

- **Increased Productivity:** Enhanced problem-solving abilities and innovation.
- **Improved Health Outcomes:** Higher IQ is linked to better health decisions, potentially reducing healthcare costs.
- **Greater Social Mobility:** Elevated cognitive abilities can lead to higher educational attainment and upward social movement.

**Conclusion**

A 5-point increase in the average IQ of the U.S. population could potentially result in an annual earnings boost of approximately $939.4 billion, alongside various other societal benefits. It's important to note that these estimates are based on observed correlations and may not capture all variables involved.
