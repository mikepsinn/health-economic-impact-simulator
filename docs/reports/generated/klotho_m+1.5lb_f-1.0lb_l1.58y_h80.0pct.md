A protein that regulates aging and metabolism

### Key Findings
- Annual Healthcare System Savings: $248.93B
- Total GDP Impact: $564.23B
- Annual Medicare Cost Reduction: $1,841,815.99T
- Quality-Adjusted Life Years Gained: 29,008,060

## Study Design

### Methodology
This analysis employs a comprehensive economic model that integrates multiple impact pathways:
1. Direct healthcare cost reductions from improved health outcomes
2. Economic gains from increased productive lifespan
3. Medicare savings from reduced healthcare utilization
4. Quality of life improvements measured in QALYs

### Data Sources
The model uses the following primary data sources:
- US Census Bureau population statistics
- Medicare cost and utilization data
- Bureau of Labor Statistics workforce data
- CDC health outcome statistics

## Intervention Analysis

### Physical Impact Pathway
### Physical Impact Calculations
Healthcare savings from body composition changes:

```
Muscle Savings = Population × Muscle_Change × $12/lb
```
Muscle-related savings: $2.99B

```
Fat Savings = Population × Fat_Change × $8/lb
```
Fat-related savings: $1.33B
Total composition savings: $4.31B


### Cognitive Impact Pathway
### Cognitive Impact Calculations
Economic gains from improved cognitive function:

```
GDP Impact = Population × IQ_Increase × IQ_to_GDP × Annual_Productivity
```
Annual GDP impact: $564.23B

Medicare savings from reduced Alzheimer's progression:

```
Alzheimer's Savings = Beneficiaries × Reduction × Cost × Medicare_Impact
```
Annual Medicare savings: $1,412,151.52T

Quality-adjusted life years gained from cognitive improvements:

```
QALYs = Population × (IQ_Effect + Alzheimer's_Effect) × Health_Quality
```
Total QALYs gained: 4,314,700


### Kidney Function Impact Pathway
### Kidney Function Impact Calculations
Medicare savings from reduced CKD progression:

```
Medicare Savings = Beneficiaries × CKD_Reduction × Cost × Medicare_Impact
```
Annual Medicare savings: $429,664.46T

Quality-adjusted life years gained from kidney improvements:

```
QALYs = Population × (eGFR_Effect + CKD_Effect) × Health_Quality
```
Total QALYs gained: 23,896,800


### Healthcare Utilization Impact
### Healthcare Utilization Impact Calculations
Savings from reduced hospital visits:

```
Visit Savings = Baseline_Visits × Visit_Reduction × Cost_per_Visit
```
Baseline annual visits: 18,250,000
Visits reduced: 2,190,000
Annual savings: $248.93B

Quality-adjusted life years gained from reduced hospitalizations:

```
QALYs = Population × Visit_Reduction × Health_Effect × Quality_Factor
```
Total QALYs gained: 796,560


## Economic Impact Calculations

### Total Healthcare System Savings
Sum of savings from all impact pathways:

```
Total Savings = Physical_Savings + Hospital_Savings + Medicare_Savings
```
Annual healthcare system savings: $248.93B

### Total GDP Impact
Economic gains from improved health and productivity:

```
GDP Impact = Cognitive_Impact + Longevity_Impact
```
Total GDP impact: $564.23B

### Quality-Adjusted Life Years
Total health improvements across all pathways:

```
Total QALYs = Physical_QALYs + Cognitive_QALYs + Kidney_QALYs + Healthcare_QALYs
```
Total QALYs gained: 29,008,060
