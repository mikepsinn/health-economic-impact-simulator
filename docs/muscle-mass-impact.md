#### Sensitivity Analysis

**Best Case:** $38832489764172024.0B total

**Worst Case:** $16642495613216580.0B total


**Key Assumptions:**

- Best case: Lower discount rate (2%)
- Worst case: Higher discount rate (4%)
- Includes economic cycle variations
- Accounts for long-term healthcare cost trends


## Methodology Notes

- All calculations use validated equations from peer-reviewed research
- Health outcomes are based on conservative estimates from meta-analyses
- Economic impact includes direct healthcare savings and indirect productivity gains
- Risk reductions are calculated using linear scaling with established upper bounds


## Limitations

- Individual results may vary based on age, gender, and baseline health status
- Long-term adherence to intervention maintenance not considered
- Intervention costs not included in economic calculations
- Results are based on population-level statistics and may not reflect individual outcomes
- Measurements in source studies may have some methodological limitations


## Statistical Validation

The predictions in our model are based on robust statistical analyses using:

- Modified Poisson regression with robust estimation
- Cox proportional hazards regression


Adjustment for multiple covariates including:

  - Age, sex, race/ethnicity
  - Smoking status
  - Medical history
  - Central obesity
  - Cardiovascular risk factors
  - Glucose metabolism measures
