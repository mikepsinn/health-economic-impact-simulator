**Project Title:** Economic Modeling for Minicircle Plasmid Therapies (Follistatin, Klotho, Thymosin-alpha-1)

**1\. Executive Summary:**

This project will develop initial, simple economic models to assess the potential financial impact of Minicircle's Follistatin, Klotho, and Thymosin-alpha-1 plasmid therapies. These models will quantify the cumulative benefit of Follistatin on muscle/fat (for different population sets) and lifespan, and the economic value of Klotho's effects on IQ, Alzheimer's, and kidney disease (measured by eGFR and cystatin C). The primary goals are to provide initial data-driven insights, particularly related to potential Medicare spending impacts and inform study design and the selection of new research candidates. The initial models will be simple, serving as a foundation for adding complexity later.

**2\. Project Goals and Objectives:**

* **Goal 1:** Develop initial, simple economic models for key plasmid therapy candidates.  
  * **Objective 1.1:** Create a simple model quantifying the cumulative economic benefit of Follistatin-induced muscle gain and fat loss across different population sets (e.g., adults, people over 60\) in the US.  
  * **Objective 1.2:** Develop a simple model to estimate the GDP impact and Medicare spending reduction resulting from a 2.5% increase in lifespan due to Follistatin.  
  * **Objective 1.3:** Build a simple model to assess the total economic value of Klotho's potential to increase IQ, slow Alzheimer's, and reduce kidney disease, focusing on the economic impact of changes in eGFR and cystatin C biomarkers.  
  * **Objective 1.4:** Develop a simple model to assess the potential economic benefits of Thymosin-alpha-1. *\[Note: Specific endpoints for Thymosin-alpha-1 will need to be defined as part of the modeling process.\]*  
* **Goal 2:** Design models for potential integration with clinical study data.  
  * **Objective 2.1:** Structure models to potentially utilize data from planned clinical studies.  
  * **Objective 2.2:** Identify potential data points that could be needed from clinical studies for each model.

**3\. Project Scope:**

* **Inclusions:**  
  * Development of initial, simple economic models for Follistatin (muscle/fat for different populations, lifespan), Klotho (IQ, Alzheimer's, kidney disease focusing on eGFR/cystatin C), and Thymosin-alpha-1 (endpoints TBD).  
  * Identification and initial application of potential economic proxy metrics based on online research review and existing literature (e.g., correlations between muscle mass and hospital visits/hip fractures).  
  * Initial analysis using publicly available data.  
  * Documentation of initial model design, assumptions, and limitations.  
  * Delivery of draft models and supporting documentation.  
* **Exclusions:**  
  * Primary data collection beyond readily available public sources.  
  * Development of software applications for model implementation.  
  * Detailed or complex econometric modeling at this initial stage.  
  * Detailed market research or regulatory strategy development.
