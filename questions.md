### Gene Therapy Impact Models
1. For Follistatin therapy showing 2 lb muscle gain and 2 lb fat reduction across US population:
   - What's the cumulative reduction in obesity-related healthcare costs?
   - How might this impact workforce productivity metrics?
   - What's the potential Medicare savings from reduced comorbidities?

2. For 2.5% lifespan extension:
   - What's the estimated GDP increase from extended workforce participation?
   - How much could Medicare save annually from delayed age-related care?
   - What's the economic value of additional healthy years gained?

3. For Klotho therapy showing:
   - 2-5 IQ point increase
   - 2-year delay in Alzheimer's progression
   - 2-year delay in kidney disease progression
   - What's the total value of preserved cognitive function?
   - How much could we reduce dementia care costs?
   - What's the Medicare savings from delayed ESRD progression?

### Study Design Considerations
4. How to structure clinical studies for direct model input:
   - Which biomarkers (eGFR/cystatin C) show strongest outcome correlations?
   - Should we stratify by age groups (e.g., >60 vs younger adults)?
   - What follow-up duration is needed to capture economic impacts?

5. For target population analysis:
   - Which subpopulations show strongest cost-benefit ratios?
   - How do outcomes differ between preventive vs treatment use cases?
   - What existing research correlations can we leverage (e.g., muscle mass â†’ hospital visits)?

### Implementation Framework
6. How to balance model complexity:
   - What's the minimum viable model for initial validation?
   - Which parameters need most sensitivity analysis?
   - Where should we prioritize adding complexity first?

7. For stakeholder alignment:
   - How does the model inform target gene selection?
   - What regulatory metrics map best to Medicare cost savings?
   - How to present findings for HHS/CMS engagement?
