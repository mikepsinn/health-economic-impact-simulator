Lifespan Impact Analysis Report
===============================

Executive Summary
-----------------
This report analyzes the economic impact of a 2.5% increase in lifespan,
focusing on GDP contribution and Medicare savings. The analysis is based on current
demographic and economic data from authoritative sources.

Methodology
-----------
The model calculates economic impacts through the following steps:

1. Calculate Additional Years:
   additional_years = base_life_expectancy * (lifespan_increase_pct / 100)
   = 79 * (2.5/100)
   = 2.0 years

2. Calculate Discount Factor:
   discount_factor = 1 / (1 + discount_rate)^additional_years
   = 1 / (1 + 0.03)^2.0
   = 0.9433

3. Calculate GDP Impact (discounted):
   productive_years = additional_years * workforce_participation
   = 2.0 * 0.62
   = 1.2 years
   
   gdp_impact = productive_years * gdp_per_capita * discount_factor
   = 1.2 * 70000 * 0.9433
   = $80,854

4. Calculate Medicare Savings (discounted):
   medicare_savings = additional_years * medicare_spending * discount_factor
   = 2.0 * 12000 * 0.9433
   = $22,356

5. Calculate Private Insurance Savings (discounted):
   private_insurance_savings = additional_years * (medicare_spending * 0.8) * discount_factor
   = 2.0 * (12000 * 0.8) * 0.9433
   = $17,885

6. Calculate Social Security Savings (discounted):
   social_security_savings = additional_years * 15000 * discount_factor
   = 2.0 * 15000 * 0.9433
   = $27,945

7. Calculate Total Economic Impact (discounted):
   total_economic_impact = gdp_impact + medicare_savings + private_insurance_savings + social_security_savings
   = 80,854 + 22,356 + 17,885 + 27,945
   = $149,040

Input Parameters
----------------
- Lifespan Increase: 2.5%
- Base Life Expectancy: 79 years [CDC, 2022]
- GDP per Capita: $70,000 [World Bank, 2023]
- Workforce Participation: 62% [BLS, 2023]
- Annual Medicare Spending: $12,000 [CMS, 2023]
- Discount Rate: 3% [Standard economic practice]

Results (All values are discounted at 3% per year)
-------
- Additional Years of Life: 2.0 years
- GDP Impact: $80,854 (discounted)
- Medicare Savings: $22,356 (discounted)
- Private Insurance Savings: $17,885 (discounted)
- Social Security Savings: $27,945 (discounted)
- Total Economic Impact: $149,040 (discounted)

Sensitivity Analysis
--------------------
The model was tested across a range of lifespan increases (5%-20%) showing:
- Linear relationship between lifespan increase and economic benefits
- Greatest impact seen in workforce participation rate
- Medicare savings scale proportionally with additional years

Conclusion
----------
This analysis demonstrates significant economic benefits from lifespan extension,
with both GDP growth and Medicare savings contributing to national economic health.
The findings support investment in interventions that extend healthy lifespan.
