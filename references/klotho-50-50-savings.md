To maximize profit under a **50/50 healthcare savings sharing program** for plasmid gene therapy that increases klotho levels, it's essential to develop a comprehensive financial model. This model should account for how pricing affects adoption rates, the total savings generated, and ultimately, the manufacturer's revenue and profit. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

## **1\. Define Key Assumptions and Variables**

Before diving into calculations, establish the foundational assumptions and variables:

- **Therapy Administration:**  
    
  - **Frequency:** Every 6 months (2 injections per year)  
  - **Duration:** Assume therapy is administered from age 50 to 80 (30 years)  
  - **Total Injections per Person:** 2 injections/year × 30 years \= **60 injections**


- **Cost-Sharing Model:**  
    
  - **Manufacturer’s Share:** 50% of long-term healthcare savings


- **Healthcare Cost Savings:**  
    
  - **Average Lifetime Savings per Person:** $100,000 (midpoint from previous estimate)  
  - **Manufacturer’s Revenue per Person:** 50% × $100,000 \= **$50,000**


- **Market Size:**  
    
  - **Target Population:** Assume an initial target of 1,000,000 individuals starting therapy at age 50  
  - **Adoption Rate:** Variable, dependent on pricing and market dynamics


- **Cost Structure:**  
    
  - **Fixed Costs:** R\&D, manufacturing setup, regulatory compliance  
  - **Variable Costs:** Cost per injection (production, distribution, administration)  
  - **For simplicity, assume variable costs are negligible compared to revenues**


- **Discount Rate:** For long-term projections, assume a discount rate (e.g., 3%) to account for the present value of future savings and revenues

## **2\. Develop the Revenue Model**

### **a. Pricing Strategy**

Determine the price per injection such that:

\[ \\text{Price per Injection} \= \\frac{\\text{Manufacturer’s Revenue per Person}}{\\text{Total Injections per Person}} \= \\frac{$50,000}{60} \\approx $833 \\text{ per injection} \]

However, to **maximize profit**, the company should consider:

- **Volume vs. Price Trade-off:** Lower prices may lead to higher adoption rates, increasing total revenue even if revenue per person decreases.  
- **Economies of Scale:** Higher volumes can reduce per-unit costs (if applicable) and enhance bargaining power with suppliers and distributors.

### **b. Financial Projections Based on Adoption Rates**

Assume different adoption scenarios based on varying prices. Here's a simplified table illustrating potential revenues:

| Price per Injection | Adoption Rate (%) | Number of Users | Revenue per User | Total Revenue |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| $500 | 80% | 800,000 | $500 × 60 \= $30,000 | $24,000,000,000 |
| $833 | 50% | 500,000 | $833 × 60 ≈ $50,000 | $25,000,000,000 |
| $1,000 | 30% | 300,000 | $1,000 × 60 \= $60,000 | $18,000,000,000 |
| $1,500 | 15% | 150,000 | $1,500 × 60 \= $90,000 | $13,500,000,000 |
| $2,000 | 10% | 100,000 | $2,000 × 60 \= $120,000 | $12,000,000,000 |

**Interpretation:**

- **At $500 per injection:** High adoption (80%), leading to substantial total revenue ($24B), but lower revenue per user ($30k).  
- **At $833 per injection:** Moderate adoption (50%), balancing revenue per user and total revenue ($25B).  
- **At $1,000 per injection:** Lower adoption (30%), with higher revenue per user but lower total revenue ($18B).  
- **Higher prices ($1,500 and $2,000):** Even lower adoption, diminishing total revenue despite higher per-user earnings.

### **c. Revenue Maximization Analysis**

To **maximize profit**, the company needs to find the **price point where total revenue is highest**. From the table:

- **$833 per injection** yields the highest total revenue ($25B) with a 50% adoption rate.  
- Lower prices ($500) generate slightly less total revenue ($24B) but attract more users.  
- Higher prices decrease total revenue significantly.

**Optimal Pricing Recommendation:** **$833 per injection** strikes a balance between per-user revenue and total adoption, maximizing overall revenue under the given assumptions.

## **3\. Incorporate Discounted Cash Flows**

Considering the long-term nature of savings and revenues, apply a discount rate to account for the time value of money. This provides a more accurate financial projection.

### **a. Present Value of Manufacturer’s Revenue**

Calculate the present value (PV) of the $50,000 revenue per person over 30 years with a 3% discount rate.

\[ PV \= \\sum\_{t=1}^{30} \\frac{$50,000}{(1 \+ 0.03)^t} \\approx $50,000 \\times 18.256 \\approx $912,800 \]

**Note:** This simplistic calculation assumes $50,000 is received at the end of the 30-year period, but in reality, revenues are spread out over time (every 6 months). A more precise calculation would discount each injection's revenue individually.

### **b. Discounted Revenue per Injection**

Assuming revenue is received at regular intervals (every 6 months), calculate the present value of each $833 payment.

Using the formula for the present value of an annuity:

\[ PV \= P \\times \\left( \\frac{1 \- (1 \+ r)^{-n}}{r} \\right) \]

Where:

- ( P \= $833 ) per injection  
- ( r \= 0.03 / 2 \= 0.015 ) per 6 months  
- ( n \= 60 ) injections

\[ PV \= 833 \\times \\left( \\frac{1 \- (1 \+ 0.015)^{-60}}{0.015} \\right) \\approx 833 \\times 41.343 \\approx $34,410 \\text{ per person} \]

**Total Present Value Revenue:**

\[ $34,410 \\text{ per person} \\times 1,000,000 \\text{ users} \= $34,410,000,000 \]

**This indicates that at $833 per injection, the present value of total revenue from 1,000,000 users is approximately $34.41 billion.**

## **4\. Profit Maximization Strategy**

To **maximize profit**, consider the following strategies:

### **a. Scale and Adoption**

- **Lower Prices for Higher Volume:** Setting a price that encourages widespread adoption can lead to higher total revenues.  
- **Value Demonstration:** Invest in robust clinical trials and real-world evidence to convincingly demonstrate long-term savings and health benefits, thereby driving higher adoption rates.

### **b. Negotiation with Payers**

- **Outcome-Based Contracts:** Engage in contracts where payments are tied to actual realized savings, aligning incentives and reducing payer risk.  
- **Bulk Purchasing Agreements:** Negotiate with large healthcare providers or insurers for bulk purchasing discounts in exchange for guaranteed volume.

### **c. Market Penetration and Expansion**

- **Geographic Expansion:** Enter multiple markets globally to increase the user base.  
- **Partnerships:** Collaborate with healthcare systems, clinics, and providers to integrate the therapy into standard preventative care protocols.

- **Incentivize Early Adoption:** Offer introductory pricing, discounts for early adopters, or bundled packages to encourage initial uptake.

## **5\. Addressing Distorted Incentives**

Healthcare systems often prioritize treatments for existing chronic conditions over preventative measures due to reimbursement structures and short-term budgeting. To overcome these distorted incentives:

### **a. Demonstrate Economic Value**

- **Comprehensive Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Provide detailed analyses showing long-term savings and improved health outcomes.  
- **Case Studies and Pilot Programs:** Implement pilot programs demonstrating real-world savings and scalability.

### **b. Advocate for Policy Changes**

- **Engage with Policymakers:** Advocate for reimbursement models that recognize and reward preventative therapies.  
- **Incentivize Preventative Care:** Support policies that provide incentives for providers to adopt preventative measures like the klotho therapy.

### **c. Align Stakeholder Interests**

- **Collaborate with Insurers:** Show how the therapy can reduce overall costs, making it attractive for insurers to cover it.  
- **Provider Partnerships:** Work with healthcare providers to integrate the therapy into preventive care guidelines.

## **6\. Sensitivity Analysis**

Perform sensitivity analyses to understand how changes in key variables affect profitability:

- **Variation in Lifetime Savings:** If actual savings differ from the assumed $100,000, adjust the manufacturer’s revenue accordingly.  
- **Adoption Rate Fluctuations:** Assess how different adoption rates impact total revenue.  
- **Price Elasticity:** Understand how sensitive adoption is to price changes to optimize the balance between price and volume.

## **7\. Example Financial Projection**

Assuming the optimal price is **$833 per injection** with a **50% adoption rate** (500,000 users):

### **a. Annual Revenue per Person:**

\[ $833 \\times 2 \= $1,666 \\text{ per year} \]

### **b. Total Annual Revenue:**

\[ $1,666 \\times 500,000 \= $833,000,000 \\text{ per year} \]

### **c. Present Value Revenue Over 30 Years:**

Using the earlier PV per person ($34,410):

\[ $34,410 \\times 500,000 \= $17,205,000,000 \]

**Total Present Value Revenue:** Approximately **$17.2 billion**

### **d. Profit Calculation:**

Assuming **negligible variable costs** and ignoring fixed costs for simplicity:

\[ \\text{Profit} \= \\text{Total Revenue} \- \\text{Total Costs} \]

If fixed costs are substantial, they must be subtracted accordingly. However, with the given assumptions, the company stands to generate significant profits, especially as adoption scales.

## **8\. Conclusion and Recommendations**
