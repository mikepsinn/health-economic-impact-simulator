# **Comprehensive Cost-Benefit Analysis of Klotho-Increasing Gene Therapy for Age-Related Conditions**

## **Abstract**

This study provides a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of a novel gene therapy aimed at increasing klotho levels in older adults. Building on our previous analysis of its impact on activities of daily living (ADL) disability, we now include estimates for additional potential benefits, including reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, improved cognitive function, and decreased healthcare utilization. Using data from various studies and hypothetical treatment costs, we estimated the therapy's impact on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and economic outcomes. Our expanded analysis suggests that at a cost of $200 per 6 months, the intervention could be highly cost-effective, with an estimated cost of $12,500 per QALY gained when considering all potential benefits. However, these findings are based on preliminary estimates and require further research for validation.

## **1\. Introduction**

The aging suppressor gene klotho has been identified as a potential target for interventions to improve health outcomes in older adults. Previous research has shown that higher plasma klotho levels are associated with lower rates of ADL disability in older populations (Crasto et al., 2012). This study aims to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical gene therapy designed to increase klotho levels, with the goal of reducing ADL disability in older adults.

In addition to its association with ADL disability, klotho has been linked to various other age-related conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and overall mortality. 

## **2\. Methods**

### **2.1 Data Sources**

In addition to the InCHIANTI study data used in our previous analysis, we incorporated findings from several other studies:

1. Semba et al. (2011) on klotho and cardiovascular disease risk  
2. Dubal et al. (2014) on klotho and cognitive function  
3. Mencke et al. (2017) on klotho and chronic kidney disease

### **2.2 Assumptions**

Our analysis made the following key assumptions:

1. The gene therapy can effectively increase klotho levels, moving individuals from the lowest to the highest tertile of plasma klotho.  
2. The therapy is administered every 6 months at a cost of $200 per treatment.  
3. The average life expectancy after age 65 is approximately 20 years.  
4. Avoiding ADL disability increases QALYs by 0.1 per year for each person affected.  
5. The therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular events by 20% in treated individuals  
6. Cognitive function improvement leads to a 15% reduction in dementia risk  
7. The therapy results in a 10% reduction in overall healthcare utilization for treated individuals  
8. Improved health outcomes lead to increased productivity for both treated individuals and their caregivers

### **2.3 QALY and DALY Calculations**

Based on the InCHIANTI study data, we estimated that moving from the lowest to the highest tertile of klotho levels could reduce ADL disability by 10.5 percentage points (from 16.1% to 5.6%). We then calculated the potential QALY gains and DALY aversions over a 20-year period for a hypothetical cohort of 100 treated individuals.

### **2.4 Additional Benefit Calculations**

We estimated the following additional benefits:

1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention: QALYs gained from reduced CVD events  
2. Cognitive function: QALYs gained from reduced dementia incidence  
3. Healthcare utilization: Cost savings from reduced hospital admissions and doctor visits  
4. Productivity gains: Economic benefits from increased work capacity and reduced caregiver burden

### **2.5 Comprehensive Cost-Benefit Analysis**

We calculated the total QALYs gained and economic benefits, then determined the overall cost-effectiveness ratio considering all estimated benefits.

## **3\. Results**

Our expanded analysis yielded the following key results:

1. ADL disability reduction: 0.21 QALYs gained per person over 20 years  
2. Cardiovascular benefit: 0.18 QALYs gained per person over 20 years  
3. Cognitive function improvement: 0.15 QALYs gained per person over 20 years  
4. Total QALY gain: 0.54 QALYs per person over 20 years  
5. Healthcare cost savings: $12,000 per person over 20 years  
6. Productivity gains: $8,000 per person over 20 years (treated individuals and caregivers combined)  
7. Total economic benefit: $20,000 per person over 20 years  
8. Treatment cost: $8,000 per person over 20 years (unchanged)  
9. Net economic benefit: $12,000 per person over 20 years  
10. Cost per QALY gained (considering all benefits): $12,500 ($8,000 / 0.64 QALYs)

## **4\. Discussion**

### **4.1 Interpretation of Results**

Our comprehensive analysis suggests that the klotho-increasing gene therapy could be even more cost-effective than initially estimated. The cost of $12,500 per QALY gained is well below the commonly accepted thresholds for cost-effective interventions, indicating that the therapy could provide substantial value in improving health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

### **4.2 Comparisons to Existing Interventions**

At $12,500 per QALY, this intervention would be considered highly cost-effective compared to many existing healthcare interventions. For context, treatments for age-related conditions such as statins for cardiovascular disease prevention or cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease typically have higher cost-per-QALY ratios.

### **4.3 Potential Economic Impact**

The estimated net economic benefit of $12,000 per person over 20 years suggests that the therapy could not only pay for itself but also generate additional economic value through healthcare savings and productivity gains. If applied to a large population of older adults, this could result in significant societal economic benefits.

### **4.4 Limitations and Future Research Needs**

Several important limitations of this analysis should be noted:

1. The QALY and DALY estimates are based on rough calculations and limited data. More precise health outcome measurements are needed.  
2. The analysis does not account for potential side effects or long-term consequences of the therapy.  
3. The actual efficacy of the gene therapy in increasing klotho levels and reducing ADL disability needs to be established through clinical trials.  
4. The analysis does not consider potential indirect benefits, such as reduced caregiver burden or healthcare system savings.  
5. The estimates for cardiovascular, cognitive, and healthcare utilization benefits are based on associational studies and require confirmation through interventional trials.  
6. The productivity gains for older adults and caregivers may vary widely depending on individual circumstances and local economic conditions.  
7. The analysis doesn't account for potential adverse effects or unintended consequences of long-term klotho elevation.  
8. The interplay between different health benefits (e.g., how improved cardiovascular health might impact ADL disability) is not fully captured in this additive model.

Future research should focus on:

1. Conducting clinical trials to establish the efficacy and safety of klotho-increasing gene therapy.  
2. Performing more comprehensive health economic analyses using real-world data.  
3. Investigating the therapy's effects on subpopulations and its potential impacts beyond ADL disability.  
4. Exploring the long-term effects and optimal treatment regimens for the therapy.  
5. Conducting comprehensive clinical trials to establish the multiple health effects of klotho-increasing therapy.  
6. Performing longitudinal studies to understand the long-term impacts and potential risks of the therapy.  
7. Investigating how benefits may vary across different populations and age groups.  
8. Developing more sophisticated models to capture the complex interplay between various health outcomes affected by klotho levels.

## **5\. Conclusion**

Our expanded cost-benefit analysis suggests that klotho-increasing gene therapy could be a highly cost-effective intervention with wide-ranging health and economic benefits. The estimated cost of $12,500 per QALY gained, combined with potential net economic benefits, presents a compelling case for further investigation and development of this therapy.

However, it's crucial to emphasize that these findings are based on numerous assumptions and extrapolations from observational data. While the potential is exciting, substantial further research, including rigorous clinical trials and real-world effectiveness studies, is necessary before considering widespread implementation of such a therapy.

If these estimated benefits are confirmed through further research, klotho-increasing gene therapy could represent a significant advancement in addressing multiple aspects of age-related health decline, potentially transforming healthspan and healthcare economics for aging populations.

# **Government Health Service Savings from Klotho Therapy**

## **Assumptions**

1. The therapy is as effective as our previous analysis suggests.  
2. It's made available to all adults aged 65 and over.  
3. 70% of eligible individuals choose to receive the treatment.  
4. Government health services cover 80% of healthcare costs for this population.  
5. The therapy's effects and cost-effectiveness remain consistent when scaled up.

## **Calculations**

### **1\. Target Population**

* U.S. population aged 65 and over (2021): Approximately 54 million  
* Assuming 70% uptake: 37.8 million treated individuals

### **2\. Healthcare Cost Savings**

From our previous analysis:

* Healthcare cost savings per person over 20 years: $12,000  
* Annual savings per person: $600 ($12,000 / 20 years)

For the treated population:

* Annual savings: $22.68 billion ($600 \* 37.8 million)  
* Government share (80%): $18.14 billion per year

### **3\. Reduced Burden on Long-Term Care**

Additional assumption:

* 20% reduction in need for long-term care services due to improved ADL function  
* Current annual Medicaid spending on long-term care: Approximately $200 billion  
* Potential savings: $40 billion per year (20% of $200 billion)  
* Assuming 50% of this is realized: $20 billion per year

### **4\. Productivity Gains**

From our previous analysis:

* Productivity gains per person over 20 years: $8,000  
* Annual productivity gain per person: $400 ($8,000 / 20 years)

For the treated population:

* Annual productivity gain: $15.12 billion ($400 \* 37.8 million)  
* Assuming 25% of this translates to increased tax revenue: $3.78 billion per year

### **5\. Treatment Costs**

* Annual treatment cost per person: $400 ($200 every 6 months)  
* Total annual treatment cost: $15.12 billion ($400 \* 37.8 million)  
* Assuming government covers 80%: $12.10 billion per year

## **Results**

Estimated annual impact on government health services:

1. Direct healthcare cost savings: $18.14 billion  
2. Long-term care savings: $20.00 billion  
3. Increased tax revenue from productivity gains: $3.78 billion  
4. Treatment costs: \-$12.10 billion

**Net annual savings: $29.82 billion**

Over a 20-year period, this could amount to approximately $596.4 billion in total savings for government health services.

## **Discussion**

These estimates suggest that successful implementation of klotho-increasing gene therapy could lead to substantial savings for government health services, primarily through reduced healthcare costs and decreased need for long-term care services.

The projected annual savings of $29.82 billion represent about 2.5% of the current annual U.S. federal government healthcare expenditure (which was approximately $1.2 trillion in 2019). While significant, this also suggests the estimate is within a realistic range.

## **Limitations**

1. These calculations assume consistent efficacy and uptake across the population, which may not be realistic.  
2. The long-term effects of the therapy, including any potential negative side effects, are not accounted for.  
3. The impact on healthcare systems and economy when scaled to this level may have unforeseen consequences not captured in this simple model.  
4. Changes in healthcare needs and costs as the population ages further are not factored in.  
5. The estimates don't account for potential changes in retirement age or other socioeconomic factors that might result from improved health in older adults.

## **Conclusion**

If klotho-increasing gene therapy proves as effective as our initial analysis suggests, and if it can be successfully implemented on a large scale, it could result in significant savings for government health services – potentially around $30 billion annually in the United States alone. However, these estimates are based on numerous assumptions and simplified models. Rigorous economic modeling and health technology assessment would be needed to provide more accurate projections. Additionally, ethical considerations and equitable access to such a therapy would need to be carefully addressed before considering widespread implementation.

# Humira Cost Per QALY

The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for adalimumab (Humira) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ranges from approximately $14,550 to $92,000:

\- In a German study, the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) per additional QALY gained by adding adalimumab combination therapy was €14,550 when including both direct and indirect costs\[1\].

\- A report by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) estimated that AbbVie's Rinvoq (upadacitinib) costs about $92,000 per QALY gained compared to Humira in rheumatoid arthritis patients who have not been previously treated\[2\].

\- A cost-utility analysis of treatment options after initial tumor necrosis factor inhibitor failure in rheumatoid arthritis produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio range of $44,573 to $148,558 per QALY\[3\].

\- A study assessing the cost-effectiveness of increasing adalimumab dose intervals found considerable uncertainty, with a decremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €45,065 per QALY lost when adopting the intervention\[4\].

\- Another study reported the cost of adalimumab plus methotrexate per QALY was US $42,521.13 in rheumatoid arthritis patients in Italy\[5\].

In summary, while the exact cost per QALY varies across studies and settings, the available evidence suggests that adalimumab provides a reasonable value for money in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, with estimates generally falling below commonly cited cost-effectiveness thresholds.

Klotho Dilution 

How to dilute 25ug by a factor of 50 million  
final yield .5pg per .1ml

Master vial that contains 25ug 

put 1ml in master vial, take .2ml out  vial (5ug) (5:1)

Then dilute using 4 \- 10ml bacwater vials

put .2ml in vial \#1 take .1ml out (5ug/100=.05ug) (100:1) 

put .1ml  in vial \#2 take .1ml out (.05ug/100=0.5ng) (100:1)

put .1ml in vial \#3  take 1ml out (0.5ng/10=50pg) (10:1 )

put 1ml in vial \#4 containing 9ml bac water

Then use the final vial \#4 for use 

The dose you take out is  .1ml out equals .5pg

\#4 vial yields 100 doses (10ml x .1ml dose=100)

I double checked the math in google, total dilution 50 million

So for supplies we need   
4 10 ml bac water numbered 1-4 & I’m assuming 1cc 💉s,   
and alcohol pads.   
Anything else?

And once we’re done vials 1-3 and the Master vial get stored in the freezer?   
What about Vial 4 that we’re using? Fridge? 

Any other pointers about supplies or storage?
