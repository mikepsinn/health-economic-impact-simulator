# [Intervention Name] Impact Analysis

This report analyzes the potential economic and health impacts of [intervention name] on Medicare spending, GDP, and population health metrics.

> **Note**: All numbers herein are for illustrative purposes only. The actual model would need real-world clinical data, demographic information, and validated economic/healthcare assumptions.

# 1. Executive Summary

[Brief description of the intervention and its mechanism of action]

Key potential benefits:
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Benefit 3]
- [Benefit 4]

To facilitate decision-making, we have devised mathematical models that estimate:

1. [Primary impact metric]
2. [Secondary impact metric]
3. [Additional metrics as needed]

# 2. Background

### 2.1 [Intervention] Mechanism

- **Mechanism of Action**: [Describe how the intervention works]
- **Intended Outcome**: [List primary outcomes]

### 2.2 Public Health Relevance

- **[Health Impact 1]**: [Description]
- **[Health Impact 2]**: [Description]
- **Economic Impact**: [Description of economic implications]

# 3. Model Framework and Assumptions

We present [X] major modeling scenarios:

1. [Scenario 1]
2. [Scenario 2]

These scenarios rely on several key assumptions:

1. **Population Size**: [Define target population]
2. **Target Demographics**: [Define key demographic assumptions]
3. **Current Costs**: [Define baseline cost assumptions]
4. **Economic Parameters**: [Define economic assumptions]

All calculations can be adjusted by modifying the parameters in the provided Python model.
