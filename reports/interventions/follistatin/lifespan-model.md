# Model 2: 2.5% Increase in Average Lifespan

## 1. Rationale
If the therapy improves metabolic health, it may extend healthy lifespan. A 2.5% increase in lifespan is considerable at the population level.

- **Current Average Lifespan**: ~77 years in the U.S. (placeholder).
- **2.5% Increase**: ~1.925 additional years (on average).

## 2. GDP Impact Analysis

### 2.1 Mathematical Framework
Let:
- ΔL = average increase in lifespan (in years)
- W = average annual worker contribution to GDP
- R = fraction of the population still in the workforce
- d% = discount rate to account for the time value of money, future productivity changes, etc.

A rough estimate of the added GDP from increased lifespan (assuming people remain in or partially in the workforce longer) might be:

```
Added GDP = P × R × ΔL × W × (1 / (1 + d))^ΔL
```

### 2.2 Example Calculation
For simplicity (ignoring discounting for now), if:
- ΔL = 1.925 years
- W = $70,000 average annual productivity
- P = 332 × 10^6
- R ≈ 50% (since not everyone is working due to retirees, children, etc.)

```
Added GDP ≈ 332 × 10^6 × 0.5 × 1.925 × $70,000 ≈ $22.45 trillion (cumulative over those extra years)
```

*This figure is a very rough, non-discounted estimate covering the entire extended lifespan. In a real model, discount rates, retirement ages, and partial productivity in older age must be considered.*

## 3. Medicare Spending Impact

### 3.1 Cost Reduction Framework
- **Longer Healthier Life** vs. **Longer Life in Poor Health**  
  Extending healthy lifespan could shift or reduce per-capita spending on chronic diseases.  

We can define:
- C_annual = average annual Medicare cost per beneficiary (~$14,000/year, placeholder)
- δ% = percentage reduction in annual Medicare cost due to improved healthspan

### 3.2 Savings Calculation
If each beneficiary consumes 5% less Medicare resources per year (due to lower chronic disease burden), the annual Medicare savings are:

```
Annual Medicare Savings = (Medicare Population) × C_annual × δ%
```

For instance, if:
- Medicare Population = 64 × 10^6
- C_annual = $14,000
- δ% = 5% = 0.05

```
Annual Medicare Savings = 64 × 10^6 × $14,000 × 0.05 ≈ $44.8 billion per year
```

## 4. Model Limitations
- Does not account for varying retirement ages
- Assumes uniform productivity gains
- Medicare savings might vary by region and demographic
- Need real clinical data to validate healthspan improvement assumptions
