This report analyzes the economic and health impacts of Follistatin: Muscle growth and fat reduction therapeutic protein.

Key effects analyzed:
1. Body composition changes: 2.0 lb muscle, 
   -2.0 lb fat
2. Longevity impact: 2.5% lifespan increase
3. Healthcare utilization: 15.0% reduction in hospital visits

The analysis includes direct healthcare savings, GDP impact from increased productive years, 
and Medicare spending reductions from improved health outcomes.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
This analysis examines the potential economic and health impacts of interventions that modify body composition and longevity. The study focuses on two primary mechanisms of impact:
1. Direct healthcare cost savings from improved body composition
2. Economic gains from increased healthy lifespan

### 1.2 Study Objectives
- Quantify the cumulative healthcare savings from population-wide body composition improvements
- Calculate the economic impact of increased lifespan on GDP and Medicare spending
- Assess the uncertainty and sensitivity of these estimates
- Provide actionable insights for policy makers and healthcare stakeholders

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Population Parameters
- Total US Population: 331.90 million
- Medicare Beneficiaries: 61.73 million
- Workforce Participation Rate: 50.0%

### 2.2 Economic Parameters
- Annual Healthcare Cost per Medicare Beneficiary: $12,500.00 dollars
- Annual Worker Productivity: $65,000.00 dollars
- Discount Rate: 3.0%

### 2.3 Intervention Parameters
- Muscle Mass Gain: 2.0 lb per person
- Fat Mass Loss: 2.0 lb per person
- Lifespan Increase: 1.98 years (2.6%)
- Healthcare Savings per Pound Improved: $10.00 dollars

### 2.4 Analytical Methods
The analysis employs several quantitative approaches:
1. **Direct Impact Calculation**: Deterministic calculations using base parameters
2. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Probabilistic analysis with parameter variations
3. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematic parameter variation to assess result robustness
4. **Age Stratification**: Demographic-specific impact assessment

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Body Composition Impact Analysis
The intervention's effect on muscle gain and fat loss yields significant healthcare savings:

**Annual Direct Healthcare Savings**:
- Total Savings: $10.33 billion dollars
- Per-Person Savings: $40.00 per person

**Calculation Methodology**:
```math
Healthcare\ Savings = Population \times (Muscle\ Gain + Fat\ Loss) \times Savings\ per\ Pound

                    = 258.30 million \times (2.0 + 2.0) \times $10.00

                    = $10.33 billion dollars
```

### 3.2 Lifespan Impact Analysis
A 2.6% increase in average lifespan produces substantial economic effects:

**GDP Impact**:
- Total Impact: $15.66 trillion dollars
- Calculation includes workforce participation and productivity gains
- Discounted at 3.0% annually

**Medicare Savings**:
- Annual Savings: $38.58 billion dollars
- Per-Beneficiary: $625.00 per beneficiary

**Calculation Methodology**:
```math
GDP\ Impact = Population \times Workforce\ Fraction \times Years\ Gained \times Annual\ Productivity \times Discount\ Factor

            = 258.30 million \times 0.50 \times 1.98 \times $65,000.00 \times discount\_factor

            = $15.66 trillion dollars

Medicare\ Savings = Beneficiaries \times Annual\ Cost \times Improvement\ Percentage

                  = 61.73 million \times $12,500.00 \times 5.0\%

                  = $38.58 billion dollars
```
